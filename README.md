This repository based on Kaggle’s competition ‘House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques.’ This competition provides you with a data set with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The challenge is to predict the final price of each home. So, I built a predictive model, using lasso and ridge regression techniques, along with feature engineering and various techniques to clean and prepare the data sets, to compete.
